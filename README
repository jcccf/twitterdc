Readme for Twitter Directed Closure
===================================

Definitions
===========
Fan
	Person who cites a celebrity
	
Fan subgraph
	Graph of people who cite a certain celebrity, excluding the celebrity

Prerequisites
=============
1. Run find_celebrities.rb to generate a list of the most highly cited people in the graph
2. Run find_citers.rb to generate the list of people who cited these celebrities for each celebrity
3. (Optional) Run find_citers_graphs.rb to cache the citer subgraphs to speed up calculations

Graph Property Calculations
===========================
find_ats_over_time.rb
	Calculate the number of @s a celebrity gets over time

find_dc.rb
	Calculate the directed closure as more people cite a celebrity

find_outdegree.rb
	Calculate the total outdegree as more people cite a celebrity
	
find_outdegree_median.rb
	Calculate the median outdegree of the fan subgraph as it grows
	
find_sccomponent2.rb
	Calculate the size of the strongly connected component of the directed fan subgraph as it grows
	
find_triangles2.rb
	Calculate the number of triangles and the number of 2 step paths of the undirected fan subgraph
	
find_ucomponent.rb
	Calculate the size of the largest component of the undirected fan subgraph as it grows
	
Helper Files
============
adj_graph.rb
	Implementation of a graph using an adjacency list
	Also has an implementation of Trajan's algorithm for finding strongly connected components of a graph
	
constants.rb
	Keeps track of types of file names
	
disjoint_set.rb
	Implementation of disjoint sets
	Used to find the size of a connected component of a graph
	
ordered_triple.rb
	Implementation of ordered triples
	Used to store 2 step paths and triangles
	
Random Files
============
cut_files.rb
	Runs the cut command on multiple files, to reduce filesize
	
Test Files
==========
test_*.rb
	Test functionality of specific scripts.
